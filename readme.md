# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/), written in Python 3.10.

Solution files and boilerplate can be generated with `new.py`, e.g.:
```
python3 new.py 1
```

The workspace is designed to work with the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/) and [Nix Environment Selector VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arrterian.nix-env-selector) out of the box.
